    A base class for entities in a domain-driven design.

    This class is generic, allowing for type-safe association
    with events of a particular base type.
    Using generics, each entity subclass can specify the types of events
    it can produce, leading to a design
    where it is clear which entity is associated with
    which events and also enabling the use of various
    event types across different entities.

    id (Optional[int]): The primary key from the database;
        may be None if the entity has not been persisted.
    uuid (UUID): A universally unique identifier for the entity instance;
        useful for referencing the entity before it has a database ID.
    _events (List[E]): A list of domain events that are yet to be dispatched.
        These are typically cleared after the events are published.
